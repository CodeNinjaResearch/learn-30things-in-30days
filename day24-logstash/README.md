Day 24: Logstash - Collect, Parse, Transform Logs

In day 5 I learned setuo and using Elasticsearch, today I'm going to learn Log Analysis using Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana.

## ELK Stack

The ELK Stack is a collection of open-source products — Elasticsearch,Logstash, Kibana and Filebeat — all developed, managed and maintained by Elastic.

- Elasticsearch - a NoSQL database that is based on the Lucene search engine. 
- Logstash - a log pipeline tool that accepts inputs from various sources, executes different transformations, and exports the data to various targets.
- Kibana - a visualization layer that works on top of Elasticsearch. 
- Filebeat - Installed on client servers that will send their logs to Logstash, Filebeat serves as a log shipping agent that utilizes the lumberjack networking protocol to communicate with Logstash
