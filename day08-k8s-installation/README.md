# Day 8: Kubernetes overview and install Minikube on windows

This is the second week of my 30 day challenge, this week I'm going to focus on container and orchestration technologies.

### Containers and Orchestration

| |Containers|Container Orchestration|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Function|Keep software separated into its own "Clean" view and operation system|Define relationships between containers, where they come from, how they scale, and how they connect t the world around them|
|Predecessors / Alternatives|Virtual Machines, Direct installation|Home grow scripts / Manual, bespoke static configuration between containers
|Packages / Vendors|Docker / RKT / Garden / LXC / Mesos|Kubernetes / Docker Swarm / Amazon ECS / Mesos|

**The Container** 

The "war" maybe coming to a close and Docker is by and far the leader.

**The Orchestration**

- A much newer space
- kubernetes has quite a lead, and emerging as the clear leader & winner
- Cooperation & formal standards bodies are more prevalent in the growth of orchestration.

**Using kubernetes Orchestrating containers**
- Containers have helped simplify & standardize how software is modularized & deployed
- Container orchestration has arisen to help equally simplify & standardize how these containers come together to make a usable software system.
- Kubernetes as a container orchestration standard
