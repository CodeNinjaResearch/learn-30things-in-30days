# Day 8: Kubernetes overview and install Minikube on windows

This is the second week of my 30 day challenge, this week I'm going to focus on container and orchestration technologies.

### Containers and orchestration

|Function|Keep software separated into its own "Clean" view and operation system|Define relationships between containers, where they come from, how they scale, and how they connect t the world around them|
|Predecessors / Alternatives|Virtual Machines, Direct installation|Home grow scripts / Manual, bespoke static configuration between containers
|Packages / Vendors|Docker / RKT / Garden / LXC / Mesos|Kubernetes / Docker Swarm / Amazon ECS / Mesos|
