# Day 7:  GraphQL: an open source data query and manipulation language

Today i'm going to learn GraphQL and build a GraphQL server with java backend.

## What is [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
