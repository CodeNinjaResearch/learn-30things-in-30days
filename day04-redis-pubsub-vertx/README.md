# Day 4: Redis message publish/subscribe programming on Vert.x

Redis is a key/value in memory data store, but it also has an utility which enable you to do quick messaging and communication between processes. Granted, thereâ€™s plenty of other messaging systems out there, but Redis is worth a look too.

Today I will create a simple Redis message publish/subscribe application by Java on Vert.x.

Let take a look on Redis publish and subscribe command first.

 - SUBSCRIBE command listens to a channel
 - PUBLISH pushes a message into a channel
 
 Start Redis server and open 2 Redis-cli programs, in first Redis client, execute SUBSCRIBE command to listen my-channel
 ```
 redis 127.0.0.1:6379> subscribe my-channel
 Reading messages... (press Ctrl-C to quit)
 1) "subscribe"
 2) "my-channel"
 3) (integer) 1
 ```
 Please note that redis-cli will not accept any commands once in subscribed mode and can only quit the mode with Ctrl-C.
 
 In second Redis client, publish a message to my-channel
 ```
 redis 127.0.0.1:6379> publish my-channel "hello"
 (integer) 1
 redis 127.0.0.1:6379>
 ```
 The message "hello" is received in first Redis client
 ```
 redis 127.0.0.1:6379> subscribe my-channel
 Reading messages... (press Ctrl-C to quit)
 1) "subscribe"
 2) "my-channel"
 3) (integer) 1
 1) "message"
 2) "my-channel"
 3) "hello"
 ```
 
 Now I start create a java program to publish/subscribe message through Redis.
