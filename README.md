# Learn 30 things in 30 days

AS a developer, the major challenge is continuously learning new technologies!!!

With a fast changing world, there's always new technical skills to master and many things to learn. Once you stopped learning, you'll be probably out of the market. What's hard about learning is not learning itself but the increasing amount of technologies to learn. 

I'm taking a challenge and will learn a technology a day for 30 days, the challenge started on _October 1, 2018_. After my daily work, I plan to spend about 2-3 hours to learn a new technology and write it down on my GitHub (include source code if coding is required), my focus is MicroServices related tools and technologies.
